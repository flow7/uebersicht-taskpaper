# uebersicht-taskpaper
My VERY first thing ever on GitHub - an attempt to create an widget for [Uebersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/), that displays a selection of tasks from your TaskPaper file, largely based on the idea of the [To Do Widget](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht-widgets/tree/master/to-do-list) (*THANKS*).


## Why?
- Because I wanted the **big 3 tasks of the day** on my Desktop
- because I wanted to learn more about github

# How to
- Download the widget files
- Copy/move the folder "taskpaper.widget" into your widget folder - easiest to find by clicking on the uebersicht menu bar.
- adjust
  - **todolistfile** the name of your taskpaper file
  - **searchtag** the tag, that defines which tasks you want to have on the screen

Done.

## Issues
- display completed tasks or not?
- a better way to program the loop
- could someone provide the regex to find tasks that are due today, i.e. a specific date?


# DISCLAIMER
Yes, please use the files as much and for whatever you like - it works for me.

BUT be warned, this is far from perfect - I literally have no idea what I'm doing - this is the first time looking at **awk**, the shell, Regex *(WTF)*, my first repository on **github** and all of that!
